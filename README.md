A few moons ago I was working on something that was generating fake user data using [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker). One of the things we wanted was to generate a [VIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number) in our "fake" dataset, which Faker doesn't do. We considered creating our own provider, but decided against it, as it wasn't super important that it be valid.

The advent of AI started, and it has become by go-to for asking AI to create a class and unit tests in Python.

## I didn't write this
Let me repeat this, I didn't write any of this code. I merely created the prompts that generated the code. The prompts are saved as git commit messages. 

I haven't put a license on this because of all the issues with AI generated code. This is just an experiment to track how well different AI systems generate this class and unit test using a well published rule set.
